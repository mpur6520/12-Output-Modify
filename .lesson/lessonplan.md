# Output

## Learning Objectives/Goals

Students will learn to interpret, trace, identify and create python code that uses:

|Concept|Explanation|Python Code|Examples|
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|Output|The computer communicates information to the user.  In this course, we use 'print' to output text to the console.|print("Text goes here")|print("Hello World!")|
|Strings|The text data type. All string data is treated as text, even if it is numerical characters.|"string goes here"| "This is a string"|

## TEACHER NOTES

This is not an entire lesson in itself - it works alongside the other output activities to take students throught the whole PRIMM framework.

Lesson slides to introduce concepts and accompany these activities [are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iQtjLPF7ZCsytrZSkp3I_v9uE4SvYNA8x5TQLKQETJU/edit?usp=sharing)

## PRIMM TASK - Modify

In the **modify** tasks, students adapt the example code to start to create code of their own.

This is a super simple example as the print statement isn't particularly adaptable.

Make sure that the students add comments to explain what the code does.

## Misconceptions/Errors to Watch Out For

- print has a capital P
- Missing brackets before/after the string
- Missing speech marks at the beginning/end of text
- Pressing enter inside the string code creates a new line
