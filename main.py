#We learned more about the print command, modifiying the message + practicing how to utilize
#different kinds of outputs - we learned about different ways to format printed text.

#the print command prints the output (stated in parentheses) to the console lab.

#this code uses the print command to output the word "Hi" along with a smiley face to
#the console log.
print("Hi :)")

#this code uses the print command to output the number 421 to the console log.
print(421)

#this is a variable to hold the word "there" - the variable is called There
There = "there"
#this code uses the print command to combine the string "hello" and the variable There to
#print the final statement "Hello there" in the console log
print("Hello " + There)

#this code uses the print command to print the answer to the expression 3*2 in the console
print(3*2)

#this code uses the print command to print the phrase "I love computer science! I cannot
#wait to learn more about python!" in two separate lines, separated by \n (a break).
print("I love computer science! \n\n I cannot wait to learn more about python!")
